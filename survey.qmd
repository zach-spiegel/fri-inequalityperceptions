Imagine all Americans are divided into five groups based on their wealth, from the wealthiest 20% to the poorest 20%. How do you think wealth in the United States is currently distributed among these five groups? 

Please enter your best estimate/guess of the percentage of total U.S. wealth held by each group.

You can put any number between 0 and 100. Make sure your percents add up to 100.
