## Inequality Perceptions App

### Purpose

The purpose of this app is to ask users how they believe wealth is divided in the United States, and then give a graphical representation of their guesses.

After submitting their demographic information, participants will assign a percentage of total wealth to five buckets (Bottom 20% to Top 20%) for their expectations and ideals.
